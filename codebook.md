#Project on tidying up the data for Coursera training

##The purpose

This file describes the input format of the data, underlying transformations coded in R and the output file specifications. The source of original data file is 


## The source

Raw data downloaded from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
on 10 JAN 2017.

##Input data

The input data contains the following data, splitted into test/train folders:

* Fixed width text files for measurements of recording devices: ~10k records on 561 variables(measurements), named as X_*.txt, *=train/test
* Each particular activity record out of these 10k is linked with the subject and activity label, given in separate files (subject_*.txt and y_*.txt)
* There are records for activities of 30 subjects
* There are 6 activity types: laying, standing, sitting, walking, walking down/upstairs, labels descriptions are in a separate file
* description of features

##Transformation

The processing R script, containing in this repo does the following:

* reads the train/test data files on measurements (see readme.md for requirements), merging them into a single file
* retains measurements only of mean/std (66 out of 561)
* joins the data on subjects and activity labels for each measurement files
* using function aggregate() retains means for each subject and activity
* label the variables using features description file
* "." is used as dec separator and ";" as variables separator
* saves to .csv format

##Tidy data

The  dataset containing the following attributes:

* data on avarage measurements for 30 subjects and 6 activities, 180 records in total
* 66 variable for each measurement  + 2 variables for index subject and activity 
* each numeric cell in the tidy datafile accounts for mean of particular measurement for given activity type and subject id\
* sorting order is primary by activity type and secondary subject
* activities = "LAYING","SITTING","STANDING","WALKING","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
* measurements =

##The guide on variable names:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
